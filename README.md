🧙‍♂️ Fantasy World — C++ OOP Program

A simple C++ program that introduces you to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by creating and displaying details of fantasy characters from a magical world.

✨ Overview:

This program defines a class called character that stores and displays information such as:

🪶 Name
🎂 Age
🧬 Race
📏 Height

When a character is created, a message “fantasy journey has started” appears, and their details are printed on the screen.

🧱 Concepts Used:

- Classes and Objects
-Constructors
-Member Functions
-Data Members (variables)

💻 Example Output:
fantasy journey has started:
Harry potter
11
wizard
4
40
fantasy journey has started:
Hermoini granger
12
witch

30
fantasy journey has started:
Ronald weasley

wizard

40


Each character’s height is also multiplied by 10 (for a fun magical twist ✨).
